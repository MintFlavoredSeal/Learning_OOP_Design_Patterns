State Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and 
forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.


Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, 
the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently:

    The pattern suggests that you extract all state-specific code into a set of distinct classes. 
    As a result, you can add new states or change existing ones independently of each other, reducing the maintenance cost.


Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals 
that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields:

    The State pattern lets you extract branches of these conditionals into methods of corresponding state classes. 
    While doing so, you can also clean temporary fields and helper methods 
    involved in state-specific code out of your main class.


Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine:

    The State pattern lets you compose hierarchies of state classes and reduce duplication 
    by extracting common code into abstract base classes.
