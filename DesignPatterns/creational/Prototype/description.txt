Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned.
The pattern declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning. 
This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your code to the class of that object.
Usually, such an interface contains just a single clone method.
